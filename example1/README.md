# Spring Bean Configuration Example

This repository provides a simple demonstration of how to configure and retrieve Spring beans using Java-based configuration with the Spring Framework. The example includes defining and managing beans in a Spring container, injecting values, and accessing the beans via a Spring context.


## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following packages and classes:

1. **`com.preprationzone.beans.Vehicle`**: A basic Java class representing a vehicle object.
2. **`com.preprationzone.config.ProjectConfig`**: This class contains the configuration for the Spring beans.
3. **`com.preprationzone.Example1`**: The entry point of the application where the Spring context is initialized, and beans are retrieved.
